               <p>Ek pyara saa rista hai tera aur mera<br>
                Ek dusre ko karte hai pareshaan<br>
                School ke wo din tere aur mere<br>
                Yaad aate hi le aati muskaan<br>
                Irritate ho jae, jab suku budhiya bulau mai<br>
                Yaad aajae wo pal kese tujhe bhuljau  mai<br>
                Bacchpan ki wo badmasi,  sath macchae masti<br>
                Picnic ki wo baate, 8th class ki hamari yaari<br>
                Is ko to bolte hai paki wali dosti hai hamari</p>

              There will always be some people to whom we will keep special affection from very small and although we don't remember very well all the moments we live with them, we always carry them in our hearts. You will always be the one, special to my heart. Even though we took different paths and saw each other less, that friendship and that affection, I feel towards you, I will continue to feel it always even if we find different friendships along the path we chose. Those friendships will always be our point of reference, who taught us however small we were, the value of true friendship and taught something as important as it is to know how to choose them well. I will always be grateful to the world that made me have met you. I love you. Always. No. Matter. What. 😘 
Happy birthday darling 🎂 big hugs and love👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩
